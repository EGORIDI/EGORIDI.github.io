# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.
#
# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# This is how to easely override the teaser standard image at anytime,
# Just apply the following snippet to a document's YAML Front Matter
# header:
#   teaser: /assets/images/my-awesome-post-teaser.jpg

# To insert a logo before the site title, place a graphic in the 
# /assets/images/ directory and add the filename to _config.yml:
# logo: "/assets/images/88x88.png"

# By default your site title is used in the masthead. You can override this text 
# by adding the following to your _config.yml:
# masthead_title: "My Custom Title"


# Enable post dates as a default
defaults:
  # _posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      show_date: true
# To disable post date for a post, add show_date: false to its YAML Front Matter, 
# overriding what was set in _config.yml.

# Instead of adding read_time: true to each post, apply as a default in _config.yml 
# like so:
defaults:
  # _posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      read_time: true

defaults:
  # _posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: true
      comments: true
      share: true
      related: true

defaults:
  # _pages
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: pages
    values:
      layout: single

defaults:
  # _foo
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: foo
    values:
      layout: single
